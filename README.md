# Rhizome.org

Online since 1996.    
Free and open-source software (FOSS) since 2014.

**rationale**

This document provides instructions for installing and running rhizome.org locally for development. Caveats: ArtBase, search and payment processing don't work locally. Powered by [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/).

## Install

Mac OS X users, use [homebrew](http://brew.sh/) and get the latest version of XCode command line tools:

```
xcode-select --install
```

Install the following packages:

```
brew install libjpeg python virtualenv
```

*homebrew works best when all warnings generated by `homebrew doctor` are fixed.*

**pull down the code**

```
$ git clone https://github.com/rhizomedotorg/rhizome.org.git
```

**configure**

```
$ cd path/to/rhizome.org/
$ cp rhizome/local_settings_example.py rhizome/local_settings.py
```

open `local_settings.py` and set `SECRET_KEY` to some string, ([docs](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/ref/settings/#std:setting-SECRET_KEY)), the default `DATABASES` configuration should work fine.

### setup env

In repo director:

```
virtualenv venv
source venv/bin/activate
```

**install project dependencies**

hold your breath!

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

*OS X users may need to this for [PIL](http://www.pythonware.com/products/pil/) compilation to succeed in the previous step:*

```
export CFLAGS=-Qunused-arguments
export CPPFLAGS=-Qunused-arguments
```

### load fixtures

```
sh sysop_roll_db.sh
```

## Usage

```
$ cd /path/to/rhizome.org
$ source venv/bin/activate
$ python manage.py runserver
```

navigate to [http://localhost:8000](localhost:8000)

ignore these errors (at any point you see them):

`Could not access or create artbase CouchDB database`   
`Failed to install index for...`

**admin panel**
